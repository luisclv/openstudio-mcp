        """Look up OpenStudio SDK classes with full method signatures.

        IMPORTANT: call before writing measures that use SDK method calls.
        Introspects the live openstudio.model module to verify which methods
        actually exist on a class, AND returns each method's full signature —
        parameter names and return type — so you can write the call correctly.
        Prevents both hallucinated method names (e.g.
        setRatedCoolingCoefficientOfPerformance) and guessed argument lists.

        Use cases:
          - "What setters does CoilCoolingFourPipeBeam have, and what args?"
          - "Does BoilerHotWater have a setEfficiency method? What does it take?"
          - "List all classes matching 'ChillerElectric'"

        Examples:
          search_api("CoilCoolingFourPipeBeam")
          search_api("Boiler", method_pattern="Efficiency|COP")
          search_api("Chiller", max_classes=5)

        Args:
            class_pattern: Regex to match class names (e.g. "CoilCooling",
                "FourPipeBeam", "Boiler"). Case-insensitive.
            method_pattern: Optional regex to filter methods (e.g. "Rated|COP").
            max_classes: Max classes to return (default 10).
            include_base: Include inherited ModelObject methods (default False).

        Returns setters, getters, and other methods grouped per class. Each entry
        is a signature string, e.g. "setSurfaceType(surfaceType) -> Boolean".

        Returns working Ruby snippets from openstudio-resources showing how to
